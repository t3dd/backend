				<h1>TYPO3 Event Code of Conduct</h1>
				<p>At the TYPO3 events, we assume that most people are intelligent and well-intended, and we're not inclined to tell people what to do. However, we want every TYPO3 event to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. To that end, this code of conduct spells out the behavior we support and don't support at TYPO3 events. The core of our approach is this:</p>
				<p>We don't condone harassment or offensive behavior, at our event venues or anywhere. It's counter to our community values. More importantly, it's counter to our values as human beings.</p>
				<p>We're voicing our strong, unequivocal support of appropriate behavior by all participants at TYPO3 events. We invite you to help us make each TYPO3 event a place that is welcoming and respectful to all participants, regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, national origin, ethnicity, or religion. So that everyone can focus on the event itself, and the great networking and community richness that happens when we get together in person, we will not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form—in person or online.</p>
				<p>Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands, sexualized images in public spaces, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention.</p>
				<p>We expect all participants—attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers—to follow the Code of Conduct during the event. This includes related social events at off-site locations, and in related online communities and social media. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Participants violating this Code of Conduct may be expelled from the event without a refund.</p>
				<p>Please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of the event staff, or contact the community working group at typo3-team-cwg@lists.typo3.org. We thank our participants for your help in keeping a TYPO3 event welcoming, respectful, and friendly to all participants.</p>
